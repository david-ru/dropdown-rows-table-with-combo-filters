# Project description

## How to start the project
Provided that there's and Angular development environment installed in the computer when this software is going to be tested, unzip the file and enter the directory "dropdown-rows-table-with-combo-filters" using a console of your likings. Then, run "npm i" so all node modules are downloaded. After that, type "ng serve" to start a server and enter the following url: http://localhost:4200/. With that you should see the components of the test.

When it's firstly accessed, the page shows all records available. Since this is an example, the original URL can't be used, so it uses mock data, so filtered queries will show the URL with the filter options but won't display any filtered data.

To see the details of any record, just click on it and more info will appear.
